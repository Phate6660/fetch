# rsfetch 2.0.0

## abstract
This is the functional and technical specification for the 2.0 release of rsfetch,
and defines the new features and changes that will be made in that release.

This spec, is not, by any stretch of imagination complete. It still needs to be completely written.

## output style
Currently, rsfetch has some negative options (e.g. `--no-kernels`) and a few positive
options (e.g. `--ip_address`). I suggest these be turned into all positive options, with 
the exception of `--no-bold` and `--no-borders`. This will result in a cleaner and more consistent
user interface. This also has the side effect that rsfetch, by default, will not output anything
unless it is specifically told to via CLI arguments.

## new information fields
Rsfetch will also include a number of new information fields in the new release.

### terminal
displays the terminal currently in use for the current shell. This does not display the default
shell, nor the shell for any other processes, just the shell for the current one.

#### Funcionality
Rsfetch will display the terminal without any capitalization, version number, or punctuation.
Examples:
```
xterm
```
```
urxvt
```
```
alacritty
```
```
st
```
In addition, some terminal names will automatically be converted. Specifically:
	- `gnome-terminal-` will have the trailing dash trimmed off.
	- `urxvtd` will become just `urxvt`

#### Technical implementation
rsfetch will recursively retrieve the parent process of the current shell. (on subsequent iterations,
it will retrieve the parent process of the last retrieved parent process instead.)

- If the retrieved process name matches any of the following non-terminal names, it will continue.
	- `tmux`
	- `screen`
- If the process name matches any of the following names, it will give the name of the current TTY
  connected to `stdin` (i.e. like the `tty` command).
	- `login`
	- `init`
- If the process name is a path (e.g. `/usr/bin/xterm`) it will return only the file name (in this case,
  `xterm`).

### CPU information
