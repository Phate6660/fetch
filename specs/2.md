# rsfetch 2.0.0

## Abstract
This is the functional and technical specification for the 2.0 release of `rsfetch`,<br>
and it defines the new features and changes that will be made in that release.

This spec is not, by any stretch of imagination, complete. It still needs to be completely written.<br>
In addition, the content will need to be revised several times.

## Output Style
Currently, rsfetch has some negative options (e.g. `--no-kernels`) and a few positive options (e.g. `--ip_address`).<br>
I suggest these be turned into all positive options, with the exception of `--no-bold` and `--no-borders`.<br>
This will result in a cleaner and more consistent user interface.<br>
This also has the side effect that `rsfetch`, by default, will not output anything unless it is specifically told to via CLI arguments.

### New layout flags
#### UI
rsfetch 2.0 will include an `-N`/`--neofetch` flag for outputting information out in a style similar to Neofetch.
Example:
```
(\/)    os: void
( . .)  wm: dwm
c(")(") pkgs: 5000
```

#### Technical Implementation
> NOTE: the terminal cursor is represented by `<>`

ASCII art will first be printed:
```
(\/)
( . .)
c(")(")
<>
```
then the terminal cursor will be moved up to the beginning of the ASCII art using the escape sequence `\033[<ascii height>A`:
```
<>
(\/)
( . .)
c(")(")
```
Then, for each information field, the cursor will be moved one line down (with `\033[1B`) and to the right until it's 
clear of the ASCII art:
```
(\/)    <>
( . .)
c(")(")
```
and the information is printed.
```
(\/)    os: void<>
( . .)
c(")(")
```

## New Information Fields
`rsfetch` will also include a number of new information fields in the new release.

### Terminal
Displays the terminal currently in use for the current shell.<br>
This does not display the default shell, nor the shell for any other processes, just the shell for the current one.

#### UI
`rsfetch` will display the terminal without any capitalization, version number, or punctuation.<br>
Examples: `xterm`, `urxvt`, `alacritty`, and `st`.<br>
<br>
In addition, some terminal names will automatically be converted. Specifically:
- `gnome-terminal-` will have the trailing dash trimmed off.
- `urxvtd` will become just `urxvt`.

#### Technical Implementation
`rsfetch` will recursively retrieve the parent process of the current shell.<br>
(On subsequent iterations, it will retrieve the parent process of the last retrieved parent process instead.)
- If the retrieved process name matches any of the following non-terminal names, it will continue.
    - `tmux`
    - `screen`
- If the process name matches any of the following names, it will give the name of the current TTY
  connected to `stdin` (i.e. like the `tty` command).
    - `login`
    - `init`
- If the process name is a path (e.g. `/usr/bin/xterm`) it will return only the file name (in this case,
  `xterm`).

### CPU Information
Displays CPU information.

#### UI
`rsfetch` will display the CPU model, number of cores, clocking, and usage in the following format:
```
<model> (<cores>) @ <clocking> (<usage>)
```
Example: `BCM2835 (1) @ 1.000Ghz (20%)`<br>

#### Technical Implementation
To be written.

### GPU information
To be written.

### Memory Information
To be written.

### Disk Information
To be written.

## Modification to existing information fields
### Uptime
In the new release, rsfetch will retrieve the contents of `/proc/uptime` and manually parse it into
the appropriate format instead of using `uptime_lib`.

## Internal changes
### Extensive cleanup
Currently, `src/main.rs` is a huge mess of random functions scattered throughout. This will have to be organized
into different files based on modules. Each file will have it's own meta structure (e.g., for "Packages" infomation field,
`struct pkgs`) and implementation (`impl pkgs {}`) so retrieving the package information will
be `pkgs.get_count(PKG_MANAGER_GENTOO).unwrap()` instead of `get_package_count_*()`.
