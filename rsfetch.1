.TH RSFETCH "1" "January 2020" "rsfetch 1.9.0" "User Commands"
.SH NAME
rsfetch - a blazingly fast fetch program for Linux and *BSD.
.SH SYNOPSIS
rsfetch --<info field> --<info field> [--help]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
rsfetch is a fast, somwhat(?) minimal information utility written in Rust, similar to Neofetch or ufetch. It currently supports Linux and (Open|Net|Free)BSD. All information fields are disabled by default, and must be manually enabled via configuration flags. 

rsfetch has no configuration file, making it even more fast. Users may instead create aliases in their ~/.${SHELL}rc.

In addition, no automatic package manager or ASCII logo mechanism is present, but must instead be manually specified.
.PP
rsfetch currently supports the "pacman", "apt", "xbps", "dnf", "pkg", "eopkg", "rpm", "apk", "pip"
"portage", and "cargo" package managers.
