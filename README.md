# fetch
My info fetch program, written in Rust. Minimalistic (for the most part).

Note: The packages section only works for Arch (or Arch-based) distros as it uses `pacman` and `paclist`.

Note 2: If you want the name of your terminal displayed, ![term](term) must be in the same directory as the fetch binary. Yes, I used a bash script, but I couldn't find a better way to do it. :(

Note 2.5: So I just noticed an odd bug with the terminal detection. You have to be in the same directory as both binaries. So I created a little bash function you can use in the meantime when I figure out how to fix it.

```
fetch () {
	pwd="$(pwd)"
	cd $HOME/.cargo/bin
	./fetch $1 $2 $3 $4 $5 $6 $7 $8
	cd "$pwd"
}
```

Note 2.75: The $1, $2, etc are for making it able to accept flags. (Like -c, -d, etc.)

Note 3: I will attempt to add support for the set terminal font, but it looks like a lot of confusing work to get done.

### Requirements
1. `lshw` for the GPU info.
2. `pacman-contrib` for the separate package counts. ~~Will add an option soon to turn those off if you don't want to install it.~~ Option has been added.

### Installation
I have prebuilt binaries in the releases tab for people who don't want to build from source, otherwise you can do this.

1. Install rust.
2. Clone the repository.
3. cd into directory.
4. `cargo install --path .` (or use `cargo install --force --path .` if you've already installed it.)

Then is should be installed into "$HOME/.cargo/bin", so make sure that's added to your $PATH.

5. Copy ![term](term) from the repo directory to "$HOME/.cargo/bin".
6. To use, put the bash function above into "$HOME/.bashrc" (If you don't care about terminal detection, you can skip steps 5 and 6.)
