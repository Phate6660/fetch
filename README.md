# fetch
My info fetch script. Minimalistic (for the most part).

### Requirements
1. `lshw` for the GPU info.
2. ![tewisay](https://github.com/lucy/tewisay) and my ![blank cow file](https://github.com/Phate6660/dotfiles/blob/master/Cow%20Files/blank.cow) for the nice looking borders.
3. `checkupdate` for the pending updates section.

Note: The "IP" section of the script will be different due to some code redaction by me. Will update screenshot at some point.
