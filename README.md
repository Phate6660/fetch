**Why I made it:** I used to use neofetch, ufetch, and 
aurafetch a lot, but then that got me thinking. I have the skill to make
 my own script, so why not? At first, it was just a simple BASH script. 
Then I decided I wanted to try my hand at Rust, as it has interested me 
for a while. So... here's the end result. I am open to any criticisms 
you have. After all, I wish to make this better (as well as improve my 
Rust skills).

### Things to Know

1. The packages section only works for Arch (or Arch-based) distros as it uses `pacman`.

2. If you plan to help, note that indentation is done with 4 spaces. It used to be tabs, but I have been told that spaces are the preferred indentation in the Rust community.

### Requirements
- `mpd + mpc` for the music info. (Completely optional, as music info is turned off by default.)

### Installation
I have prebuilt binaries in the releases tab for people who don't want to build from source, otherwise you can do this.

1. Install rust and cargo.
2. Clone the repository.
3. `cd fetch; make; sudo make install`

Uninstall with `sudo make uninstall`.

#### AUR package
Optionally, if you use a Arch-based distro, you can use either of the following AUR packages:
- [rsfetch-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/rsfetch-git/) (This requires Rust as it builds from source.)
- [rsfetch-bin](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/rsfetch-bin/) (This grabs the latest binary from releases.)

### Screenshots

**Help**

**Default Fetch**

**My Preference of Options + Execution Time**
![Default](Screenshots/preference.png?raw=true "Default")

You can't see what options I choose because I aliased rsfetch to fetch. Here is the actual command ran.

`rsfetch -C 0 -h false -i false -l false -u false`

And yes, you saw right. Execution time was 0.012s! Crazy fast.

### License

I have set my repo to "The Unlicense". Anyone can do anything they want, with anything in my repo.
