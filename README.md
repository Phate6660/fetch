# fetch
My info fetch program, written in Rust. Minimalistic (for the most part).

Note: The packages section only works for Arch (or Arch-based) distros as it uses `pacman` and `paclist`.

### Requirements
1. `lshw` for the GPU info.
2. `pacman-contrib` for the separate package counts. Will add an option soon to turn those off if you don't want to install it.
