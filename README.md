### Preface

**Why I originally made it:** I used to use neofetch, ufetch, and 
aurafetch a lot, but then that got me thinking. I have the skill to make
 my own script, so why not? At first, it was just a simple BASH script. 
Then I decided I wanted to try my hand at Rust, as it has interested me 
for a while. So... here's the end result. I am open to any criticisms 
you have. After all, I wish to make this better (as well as improve my 
Rust skills).

**Why I want to continue improving this:** When this first started out, it 
was a simple pet project for learning how to code in Rust. Now that I have
people helping me with this project, I would love to see this turn into a
worthy alternative to neofetch/ufetch/screenfetch. Please, if there's anything 
that you feel is missing from this, open an issue. I would love to hear people's
thoughts on how this is.

**Another notice:** If you show off `rsfetch` anywhere, please let [/u/Valley6660](https://www.reddit.com/user/Valley6660/) know or open up an issue here.
He'd absolutely love to see `rsfetch` used by someone other than himself.
And if you share, there's a very good possibility of your screenshot being included in the README!
(I'm totally not trying to bribe people into using it, shhhhhhh.)

### Things to Know

1. If you plan to help, note that indentation is done with 4 spaces. It used to be tabs, but I have been told that spaces are the preferred indentation in the Rust community. ~~Any new changes should be recorded in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).~~

2. These are the current package managers supported. If I missed any, please report it in [this](https://github.com/rsfetch/rsfetch/issues/28) issue.
    - pacman
    - apt
    - xbps
    - dnf
    - eopkg
    - pkg
    - rpm
    - apk
    - portage (note: requires portage-utils to be installed as it uses qlist)
    - cargo
    - pip

3. The music info obtains the info from a locally running `mpd` server using `mpc`. If you want more music sources supported, let me know by opening up an issue.

### Installation
I have prebuilt binaries in the releases tab for people who don't want to build from source, otherwise you can do this.

#### Prerequisites
- the Rust compiler toolchain
- **GNU** Make (makefile not compatible with `bmake`!)

You have two methods to build from source:

##### make
(Choose either 3 or 4, but don't do both.)
1. Clone the repository
2. `cd rsfetch`
3. `sudo make install`
4. Or use `make DESTDIR="/home/$USER" PREFIX=".cargo/" install` to install to `$HOME/.cargo/bin`

Uninstall with `sudo make uninstall`.

##### cargo
1. Clone the repository
2. `cd rsfetch`
3. `cargo install --path .`
4. `sudo cp rsfetch.1 /usr/share/man/man1/` (for optional manpage, skip if unwanted)

Uninstall with `cargo uninstall rsfetch`

#### distro repos
[![Packaging status](https://repology.org/badge/vertical-allrepos/rsfetch.svg)](https://repology.org/project/rsfetch/versions)

If you use an Arch-based distro, you can use either of the following AUR packages:
- [rsfetch-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/rsfetch-git/) (This requires Rust as it builds from source.)
- [rsfetch-bin](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/rsfetch-bin/) (This grabs the latest binary from releases.)

If you are on BSD, it is in Fresh Ports (thanks to whoever maintains that package, I was ecstatic to see it):
- [rsfetch](https://www.freshports.org/sysutils/rsfetch/) (Requires Rust and pkgconf as it builds from source.)

If you are on Gentoo, you can install it from the overlay I co-created:
1. Install [p6nc-overlay](https://github.com/p6nc/overlay)
2. Make sure repos and overlays are synced: `sudo emerge --sync`
3. `sudo emerge -atv rsfetch`

#### cargo
If you already have `rust` and `cargo` setup, you can install it with:<br>
`cargo install rsfetch`

If you want the manpage:<br>
`sudo curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rsfetch/rsfetch/master/rsfetch.1 -o /usr/share/man/man1/rsfetch.1`

### Benchmarks
TODO: Update benchmarks. They are out of date by a lot. My latest hyperfine run for rsfetch actually resulted in 1.1ms result time, but I don't currently have the other fetch tools to compare.


Here's a detailed benchmark; with rsfetch versus ufetch, pfetch, aurafetch, Neofetch, and ScreenFetch:

```
Benchmark #1: target/release/rsfetch -NcldkuUH@swp apt
  Time (mean ± σ):      20.5 ms ±  20.2 ms    [User: 10.8 ms, System: 5.3 ms]
  Range (min … max):    14.4 ms … 117.2 ms    25 runs
 
  Warning: The first benchmarking run for this command was significantly slower than the rest (117.2 ms). This could be caused by (filesystem) caches that were not filled until after the first run. You should consider using the '--warmup' option to fill those caches before the actual benchmark. Alternatively, use the '--prepare' option to clear the caches before each timing run.
 
Benchmark #2: ufetch
  Time (mean ± σ):     180.4 ms ±  10.4 ms    [User: 154.4 ms, System: 24.9 ms]
  Range (min … max):   171.4 ms … 211.9 ms    14 runs
 
Benchmark #3: pfetch
  Time (mean ± σ):     146.2 ms ±   3.7 ms    [User: 123.5 ms, System: 19.1 ms]
  Range (min … max):   141.4 ms … 155.9 ms    19 runs
 
Benchmark #4: aura -n "term"
  Time (mean ± σ):     138.4 ms ±   3.5 ms    [User: 109.6 ms, System: 26.0 ms]
  Range (min … max):   132.2 ms … 145.8 ms    21 runs
 
Benchmark #5: neofetch --disable resolution --disable theme --disable icons --disable term --disable cpu --disable memory
  Time (mean ± σ):     454.2 ms ±  23.6 ms    [User: 327.3 ms, System: 101.6 ms]
  Range (min … max):   427.6 ms … 507.6 ms    10 runs
 
Benchmark #6: screenfetch -d "-gtk;-res;-disk;-mem;-cpu"
  Time (mean ± σ):     647.4 ms ±  33.1 ms    [User: 480.3 ms, System: 133.6 ms]
  Range (min … max):   622.5 ms … 731.6 ms    10 runs
 
Summary
  'target/release/rsfetch -NcldkuUH@swp apt' ran
    6.76 ± 6.67 times faster than 'aura -n "term"'
    7.14 ± 7.05 times faster than 'pfetch'
    8.81 ± 8.71 times faster than 'ufetch'
   22.19 ± 21.93 times faster than 'neofetch --disable resolution --disable theme --disable icons --disable term --disable cpu --disable memory'
   31.63 ± 31.25 times faster than 'screenfetch -d "-gtk;-res;-disk;-mem;-cpu"'
```
