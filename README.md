### Preface

**Why I originally made it:** I used to use neofetch, ufetch, and 
aurafetch a lot, but then that got me thinking. I have the skill to make
 my own script, so why not? At first, it was just a simple BASH script. 
Then I decided I wanted to try my hand at Rust, as it has interested me 
for a while. So... here's the end result. I am open to any criticisms 
you have. After all, I wish to make this better (as well as improve my 
Rust skills).

**Why I want to continue improving this:** When this first started out, it 
was a simple pet project for learning how to code in Rust. Now that I have
people helping me with this project, I would love to see this turn into a
worthy alternative to neofetch/ufetch/screenfetch. Please, if there's anything 
that you feel is missing from this, open an issue. I would love to hear people's
thoughts on how this is.

### Things to Know

1. If you plan to help, note that indentation is done with 4 spaces. It used to be tabs, but I have been told that spaces are the preferred indentation in the Rust community. ~~Any new changes should be recorded in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).~~

2. These are the current package managers supported. If I missed any, please report it in [this](https://github.com/rsfetch/rsfetch/issues/28) issue.
    - pacman
    - apt
    - xbps
    - dnf
    - eopkg
    - pkg
    - rpm
    - apk
    - portage (note: requires portage-utils to be installed as it uses qlist)
    - cargo
    - pip

3. The music info obtains the info from a locally running `mpd` server using `mpc`. If you want more music sources supported, let me know by opening up an issue.

### Installation
I have prebuilt binaries in the releases tab for people who don't want to build from source, otherwise you can do this.

#### Prerequisites
- the Rust compiler toolchain
- **GNU** Make (makefile not compatible with `bmake`!)

1. Clone the repository.
2. `cd rsfetch; make; sudo make install`

Uninstall with `sudo make uninstall`.

#### AUR package
Optionally, if you use a Arch-based distro, you can use either of the following AUR packages:
- [rsfetch-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/rsfetch-git/) (This requires Rust as it builds from source.)
- [rsfetch-bin](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/rsfetch-bin/) (This grabs the latest binary from releases.)

#### ebuild
~~I just switched over to Gentoo a few days ago, so whenever I figure out how to make (and share) ebuilds, there will be one released. :)~~ So it turns out that not only am I terrible at pkgbuilds, but also ebuilds. If anyone could make one for me, that would be amazing.

#### Cargo
If you already have `rust` and `cargo` setup, you can install it with `cargo install rsfetch`.

### Benchmarks

Here's a detailed benchmark, with rsfetch versus Neofetch and ScreenFetch:

Note: All programs are using default options, no flags or config files were used.

$ `hyperfine "\rsfetch" "pfetch" "neofetch --config none" "screenfetch"`

```
Benchmark #1: \rsfetch
  Time (mean ± σ):       1.4 ms ±   0.3 ms    [User: 0.6 ms, System: 1.0 ms]
  Range (min … max):     1.2 ms …   3.2 ms    1084 runs
 
Benchmark #2: pfetch
  Time (mean ± σ):      41.4 ms ±   2.8 ms    [User: 27.2 ms, System: 18.6 ms]
  Range (min … max):    36.3 ms …  47.4 ms    75 runs
 
Benchmark #3: neofetch --config none
  Time (mean ± σ):     228.1 ms ±   4.6 ms    [User: 124.7 ms, System: 114.9 ms]
  Range (min … max):   220.7 ms … 238.7 ms    12 runs
 
Benchmark #4: screenfetch
  Time (mean ± σ):     392.0 ms ±   8.4 ms    [User: 170.3 ms, System: 250.6 ms]
  Range (min … max):   382.3 ms … 406.9 ms    10 runs
 
Summary
  '\rsfetch' ran
   28.58 ± 5.69 times faster than 'pfetch'
  157.65 ± 29.70 times faster than 'neofetch --config none'
  270.96 ± 51.09 times faster than 'screenfetch'
```

As you can see, `rsfetch` is the clear winner.  

And yes, you saw right. Execution time was <1ms on average! Crazy fast.
